    "Nutrition Pro was born out of my immense struggle to sort through the labyrinth of online pet nutrition noise years ago, when I decided to feed my dog a homemade diet. It seemed like everyone on earth had an opinion on the topic, and I had no idea who to listen to. It took me years to undertand the inner workings of how to properly formulate a nutritionally balanced diet.
    There was a tremendous lack of understanding from pet owners around nutrition and certification. Most of those interested in a homemade diet were avoiding nutritionist consultations and instead opting to buy online recipes, almost all of which were nutritionally imbalanced and far too rigid to follow long-term. Too many well-intentioned people’s pets were being harmed due to simple lack of understanding.
    I decided then to make it my mission to share what I'd learned over the years by combining great tech talent with knowledge from leading veterinary nutritionists, and founding MyFurTribe. Together we’ve developed an app that is a powerful solution to this problem, yet is simple enough for any pet owner to use. Every feature in Nutrition Pro is designed with pet parents like myself in mind - from the recipe cost estimate, to the "Substitute" button, to the product links and beyond. We're very proud to have created the most flexible and powerful homemade nutrition tool anywhere, and I can think of nothing more rewarding than helping great pet parents feed nutritionally balanced fresh food diets."
